- database works on normalization while datawarehouse works on de normalization
- metadata -> repository
- informatica is frontend
  - informatica can't read files on his own
  - the files are converted into logical then it can be read only
  - orcale will be there to read all the files from rep
  - informatics need a support of rdbms (oracle)
  - informatica gives error at the end of the excution that's the drawback of informatica

- schema is a collection of objects stored in a place and active when required.
- FACT TABLE is summerized data stored in a star schema under data mart
- A data mart can consist of one start sechema or multiple start schema
- dimension are descriptive in nature which is a part of star schema 
- fact tbale consist of foreign key
- while dimension table consist of primay key
- first we design dimension table and then fact tbale comes into the picture
- SNOWFLAKE sceme is extension of dimension (we have chlid and parental chain in snowflake)
- snowflake schema leds us to database instead of dataware house
- dont create too many snowflake schema, we have to prevent creating snowflake schema

Q. difference between mysql and oracle, bcz mysql is not good for production . so is oracle good for produciton . like client - server architecture ?

- first designer -> workflow manager -> workflow monitor -> rep monitor

## Informatioca power centre
- "database neutal" - will communicatew with any database
- powerful data transformation covert one application's data to another's format
- metadata and lineage analysis (reports and metadata manager)


** in dataware house we talk in dimenion table and facts table, while in db it all about tables **
- A decision support system (DSS) is a system—specifically, an interactive information system—built on top of a data warehouse to make it easy to query or pull information from data

## ETL FOR DATA WAREHOUSING
- OPERATIONAL SYSTEM (EXTRACT)
  - RDBMS -> MAINFRAME -> OTHER
    - Transaction data
    - Optimized for transaction response time
    - current
    - normalized or de normalized data

- (TRANSFORM)
  - aGGREGATE DATA
  - cLEANSE DATA
  - CONSOLIDATE DATA
  - APPLY BUSINESS DATA
  - DE NORMALIZE DATA

- DECISION SUPPORT (LOAD)
  - DATA WAREHOUSE
    - Aggregated data
    - Historical data

- What is Data Granularity?
  - Data granularity is a measure of the level of detail in a data structure. In time-series data, for example, the granularity of measurement might be based on intervals of years, months, weeks, days, or hours.

** log files are generated in case of online (client - server architecture) for example while chatting in whatsapp log files are generated, while in case of ms word its not based on client server and its offline so there is no need of log files to create **

### parsed data
- passing -> execution -> fetching
- write a query -> goes for parsing -> then it takes help from metadata -> fetching happend with the help of cursor


## Notes
- see, the thing is that. Informatica cant read files on his own so we have orcale to read files and convert it into informatica readable format and then we do the mapping bewtween soruce and target
- *source qualifier* is native datatype generated by informatica
- session is one to one
- while workflow is one to many, one workflow can have multiple session
- FUNCTIONAL -> TECHNICAL -> BACK TO FUNCTIONAL

### DATABASE VS DATAWARE HOUSE
** data model refers to database, while dimension model is refer dataware house **
- We build the dataware on the basis of INMON AND kIIMBALL theory (IMP)

** CONFIRM DIMENSION
-
- is used to connect 2 fact table from different stat scheman, and there will be n number of confirm dimension (within the a single datamart)
- the confirm dimension is used to connect 2 data mart (in dataware house, to connect 2 different datamart)
- it contain the common attributes between the 2 different star schema (fact table common attribute) for example, we have sales and marketing  start schema and the common attribute between those start schema is product. so while connect these 2 star schema the confirm dimension will contain only the product.

** MOST OF THE TIME KIMBALL THEORY IS USED **
