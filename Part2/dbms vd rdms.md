- database works on normalization while datawarehouse works on de normalization
- metadata -> repository
- informatica is frontend
  - informatica can't read files on his own
  - the files are converted into logical then it can be read only
  - orcale will be there to read all the files from rep
  - informatics need a support of rdbms (oracle)

- schema is a collection of objects stored in a place and active when required.

Q. difference between mysql and oracle, bcz mysql is not good for production . so is oracle good for produciton . like client - server architecture ?

- first designer -> workflow manager -> workflow monitor -> rep monitor

## Informatioca power centre
- "database neutal" - will communicatew with any database
- powerful data transformation covert one application's data to another's format
- metadata and lineage analysis (reports and metadata manager)


** in dataware house we talk in dimenion table and facts table, while in db it all about tables **
- A decision support system (DSS) is a system—specifically, an interactive information system—built on top of a data warehouse to make it easy to query or pull information from data

## ETL FOR DATA WAREHOUSING
- OPERATIONAL SYSTEM (EXTRACT)
  - RDBMS -> MAINFRAME -> OTHER
    - Transaction data
    - Optimized for transaction response time
    - current
    - normalized or de normalized data

- (TRANSFORM)
  - aGGREGATE DATA
  - cLEANSE DATA
  - CONSOLIDATE DATA
  - APPLY BUSINESS DATA
  - DE NORMALIZE DATA

- DECISION SUPPORT (LOAD)
  - DATA WAREHOUSE
    - Aggregated data
    - Historical data

- What is Data Granularity?
  - Data granularity is a measure of the level of detail in a data structure. In time-series data, for example, the granularity of measurement might be based on intervals of years, months, weeks, days, or hours.

** log files are generated in case of online (client - server architecture) for example while chatting in whatsapp log files are generated, while in case of ms word its not based on client server and its offline so there is no need of log files to create **

### parsed data
- passing -> execution -> fetching
- write a query -> goes for parsing -> then it takes help from metadata -> fetching happend with the help of cursor


## Notes
- see, the thing is that. Informatica cant read files on his own so we have orcale to read files and convert it into informatica readable format and then we do the mapping bewtween soruce and target
- *source qualifier* is native datatype generated by informatica
